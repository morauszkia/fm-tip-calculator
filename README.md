## My process

### Built with

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - JS framework
- Reactive store
- [vue-debounce](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-debounce) - For debouncing inputs
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Scoped styles
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite](https://vite.dev) - Build Tool

### What I learned

Using Vue.js did not come naturally, and for example, I had to look up ways to use `v-model` with custom components, and how to validate custom components. I decided to use a store to be able to access state more convenient.

### Continued development

In the future it would be great, if I could rebuild this using some other framework. As I am most familiar with React, using Svelte would be a nice challenge. Also, in the future I would like to try some form validation library and also Pinia for state management.

### Useful resources

- [Vue docs](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html)
- [Vite docs](https://vite.dev/guide/assets.html) - These helped me a lot, especially with static asset handling and deployment.concept.
